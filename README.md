# Global-Healthcare-Optimal-Budget-Allocation
Healthcare budget optimization using linear programming

The objective of this project was to formulate a robust strategy for healthcare expenditure optimization at the global level for 10 different countries (different income levels). To achieve this, a Linear Programming (LP) model has been formulated, integrating a comprehensive set of variables and constraints to simulate the complexities of the healthcare ecosystem.
